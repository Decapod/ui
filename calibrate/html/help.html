            <h2>What is Stereo Calibration?</h2>

            <p>Stereo calibration is the process of calculating the position and orientation of two cameras relative to each other.</p>

            <p>This process is important if images are captured using stereo 3D and need to be dewarped. Without the calibration information, the stereo images will not flatten.</p>

            <p>It is recommended that before any capturing in stereo 3D is done, this calibration process be done first.</p>

            <h2>How Run Stereo 3D Calibration</h2>

            <p>To perform calibration, a checkerboard pattern is held in full view of both cameras and pictures are taken. Between taking each pair of photos, the checkerboard is tilted differently or its position changed before another photo is taken.</p>

            <p>A total of 23 pairs of photos are taken during this process.</p>

            <p>Once 23 pairs are ready, they are processed through the Stereo 3D Calibration tool. The Stereo 3D Calibration tool generates a  file containing the calibration information, which is then saved to a user-specified location.</p>

            <ol>
                <li> Take 23 pairs of photos of the checkerboard pattern in different positions and orientations. Instructions on how to do this follows below.</li>
                <li> Create a ZIP file containing all 23 image pairs (46 images total).</li>
                <li> Launch Firefox and load the Stereo 3D Calibration tool by entering the server’s address in the location bar. By default the address is: <a href="http://localhost:8080/"><code>http://localhost:8080/</code></a>.</li>
                <li> Add the ZIP file containing the 23 image pairs (created in Step 2 above) and select “Calibrate” to begin the calibration process.<p class="note"><em>Note:</em><br />
                Calibration may take 5 to 60 minutes.</p></li>
                <li> When calibration is complete, save the file calibration.zip to a location when prompted.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><code>calibration.zip</code> file is needed later for Stereo Dewarping, so it is recommended that the file be saved in a safe location, preferably the same directory where work is being done.</p>

            <h2>How to capture calibration photos</h2>
            <p>Before taking any photos, the equipment used for capturing needs to be set up. To set up cameras for Stereo, please see the Decapod Equipment Setup Guide on the Decapod wiki: <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Decapod">http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Decapod</a>.</p>

            <p class="note"><em>Note:</em><br />
            When the cameras are in place, do not change their positions or orientation relative to each other during the calibration process or during stereo capture. If camera positioning is changed, the images captured up to this point should be deleted and the calibration process restarted.</p>

            <p>Once the equipment is in place, take 23 pairs of photos of the checkerboard. The checkerboard can be positioned in any way in front of the cameras as long as the following requirements are satisfied:
            <ul>
                <li> the checkerboard is fully visible from both cameras.</li>
                <li> the cameras do not get bumped or changed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Capture procedure:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Position checkerboard in front of cameras, and ensure checkerboard is visible from both cameras. If checkerboard is not completely visible, then adjust the cameras higher, or place the subject lower.</li>
                <li> While holding the checkerboard still, take a picture with both cameras. The Decapod Capture tool can be helpful in this situation as it can take pictures from both cameras simultaneously.</li>
                <li> Change the tilt / position / orientation of the checkerboard while ensuring it is viewable by both cameras.</li>
                <li> Repeat Steps 2 to 3 until 23 pairs of photos are taken.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="note"><em>Note:</em><br />
            It is recommended that all calibration images and calibration data be saved in a location that is associated with the work being done. This way it is clear that certain calibration data belongs with a particular unit of work.</p>

            <p>For additional examples and instruction of how to do this calibration, please visit the Decapod wiki: <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Decapod">http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Decapod</a>

            <h2>Using Decapod’s Capture Tool to do Calibration</h2>
            <p>Decapod’s Capture application can make the calibration process easier by:
            <ul>
                <li> taking photos simultaneously from both cameras which can be faster than triggering the cameras manually.</li>
                <li> the Decapod Capture tool also creates a ZIP file of the images (with proper file names) so it can be used directly in the Stereo 3D Calibration tool without additional work.</li>
            </ul>
